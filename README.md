# Volksbot ROS2 branch

This branch contains the in progess migration of the volksbot package to ROS2 after applying the ros-migration-tool. After successful use of the migration tool not all ROS code snippets are converted into ROS2, like the subscriber, publisher and services. This further migration is now done manually.
