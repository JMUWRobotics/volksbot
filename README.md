## Installation Notes
[Official installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for ROS2 Humble Hawksbill

Generally ROS2 can be installed along side of ROS without any problems

But make sure to comment out any source commands for ROS1 in your `.bashrc`

- ### [installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html) for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa

    ROS2 can only be installed by compiling the source locally for Ubuntu 20.04.

    #### Potential problems:
    
    - calling ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ...``` results in:

            E: The repository 'cdrom://Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS _Focal Fossa_ - Release amd64 (20230316) focal Release' does not have a Release file.
            N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
            N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

        > Solution: Go to `Software & Updates` and disable the option `Cdrom with Ubuntu 20.04 'Focal Fossa'`
    
    
    - Building/Compilation fails with an `ICE` (Internal Compiler Error):
        
        > for example a crash of `cc1plus`

        These problems are mostly due to insufficient RAM or other lack of resources. To resove these Problems try the following steps:

        - Step 1: make sure to have a large enough `/swapfile` (rule of thumb: ```size of swapfile == size of RAM```):
            > if not you can follow this [guide](https://askubuntu.com/a/1264577) or other similar guides
        
        - Step 2: build the source with a reduced set of jobs:
            > `$ MAKEFLAGS=-j8 colcon build --parallel-workers=2 --symlink-install`
    
    #### Post-Installation Problems:

    - calling subcommands like `ros2 node ...` or `ros2 topic ...` fails or results in an error:
    
        - make sure that the daemon is running by calling `ros2 daemon status`

        - if daemon is not running, start daemon with `ros2 daemon start`

    - calling subcommands like `ros2 node list` or `ros2 daemon start` results in a ros-internal python error in scripts like _`create_daemon`_ etc.:

        for **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**:
        
        - remove your local ros2 source code
            > $ rm -rf ~/ros2_humble/
        
        - reinstall ros2 humble for **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** by following the [installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html) from above.

        for other distros: **N/A**
